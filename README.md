# Motion Prediction of Automated Vehicle

### Goal of Motion Prediction

It aims to forecast the upcoming headings, velocities, and positions of moving objects in the surrounding environment over a limited time. The expected trajectories also help us to ensure that the ego vehicle's planned path won't collide with any other objects in the future.

--> The goal of this project is to forecast the trajectory of an ego vehicle depending on the objects in its immediate environment such as cars, pedestrians, motorbikes or bicycles.

- **Libraries** - Numpy, PyTorch, PyTorch Lightening, Scikit learn, Pandas, MatplotLib, Plotly

- **Language** - Python

### Dataset used -  [inD Dataset](https://www.ind-dataset.com/)

 - The drone recorded the road users' naturalistic behavior at 4 different German intersections over a certain period of time.

 - 33 Recordings at four different recording locations

- One recording is ~ 15 minutes

 - The dataset included more than 13,500 objects such as vehicles, bikes, and pedestrians at junctions in the following [format](https://www.ind-dataset.com/format).

- The validation (test) dataset line is stable after 40 epochs
- The prediction of test dataset (unseen) will be close to accurate
  
--> Although the constant acceleration model exhibits minimal error, its application in real-world scenarios is deemed impractical due to oversimplified assumptions. 
In contrast, **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** networks emerge as the most pragmatic choice for predictive modeling, given their capacity to incorporate and analyze intricate time-series data patterns.

--> The average displacement error (average Euclidean distance between the position prediction and ground truth) is found to be 0.9 m

--> The average absolute heading error (average absolute deviation of the heading of the ego vehicle from the ground truth value) is 3.62 degrees

### Future Scope

- Vehicular communication (V2V, V2X, V2I)
- Improved Prediction Accuracy
- Real-time Applications
- Behavior Prediction and Human Intent Recognition
- Can use Kalman Filter for motion prediction
